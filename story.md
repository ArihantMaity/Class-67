                              Thirsy crow

Once upon a time, there was a crow whhich was roaming around in the village for most of the day to search for its prey so that it could feed its chicks. After hours and hours of searching it started to feel thirsty. Soon the crow started to look for water. Then at the least he spotted a pot which held water in it. As the crow came close to the lid of the water. It noticed that there was a little water in the pot and near its base.
